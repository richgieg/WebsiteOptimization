# Website Optimization

This is the fourth project in my pursuit of the Front-End Web Developer
Nanodegree from Udacity. Following is Udacity's description for this project:

"As web applications become increasingly interactive and accessed on a variety
of devices there are a variety of opportunities in which performance issues can
hinder the user experience. This project presents a number of those performance
issues and provides an opportunity to showcase your skills in identifying and
optimizing web applications."

Stay tuned for more info.
